**Functions

// Task 1: Convert Minutes into Seconds
// Write a function that takes an integer minutes and converts it to seconds.

// Task 2: Return the Next Number from the Integer Passed
// Create a function that takes a number as an argument, increments the number by +1 and returns the result.

// Task 3: Convert Hours into Seconds

// chickens = 2 legs
// cows = 4 legs
// pigs = 4 legs
// The farmer has counted his animals and he gives you a subtotal for each species. You have to implement a function that returns the total number of legs of all the animals.

// Task 6: Compare Strings by Count of Characters
// Create a function that takes two strings as arguments and return either true or false depending on whether the total number of 
// characters in the first string is equal to the total number of characters in the second string.

// Task 7: Is the Word Singular or Plural?

// Task 8: Case Insensitive Comparison
// Write a function that validates whether two strings are identical. Make it case insensitive.

// Task 9: Convert Number to Corresponding Month Name

// your function should return "March", because March is the 3rd month.


// Task 10: Write a functions that accepts one parameter and checks if the parameter is a Truthy or Falsy?

** Arrays

// Task 0: Create an array
// Create a function that takes an number and creates array with all numbers till that number.

// Task 1: Return the First Element in an Array
// Create a function that takes an array and returns the first element.

// Task 2: Reverse an Array
// Write a function to reverse an array.

// Task 3: Find the Index
// Create a function that searches for the index of a given item in an array. If the item is present, it should return the index, otherwise, it should return -1.

// Task 4: Check if an Array Contains a Given Number
// Write a function to check if an array contains a particular number.

// Task 5: Negate the Array of Numbers
// Given an array of numbers, negate all elements contained within.

// Task 6: Difference of Max and Min Numbers in Array
// Create a function that takes an array and returns the difference between the biggest and smallest numbers.

// Task 7: Multiply by Length
// Create a function to multiply all values in an array by the amount of values in that array.

// Task 8: Hurdle Jump
// Create a function that takes an array of hurdle heights and a jumper's jump height, and determine whether or not the hurdler can clear all the hurdles.
// A hurdler can clear a hurdle if their jump height is greater than or equal to the hurdle height.

// Task 9: Generate a Countdown of Numbers in an Array
// Create a function that takes a number as an argument and returns an array of numbers counting down from this number to zero.

// Task 10: Odd Up, Even Down
// Create a function that goes through the array, incrementing (+1) for each odd number and decrementing (-1) for each even number.
